    "description": "The Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) is a distribution problem in which a product must be shipped from a supplier to several customers over a planning horizon. Each customer has a maximum inventory level and a known demand rate. The supplier, following a vendor-managed inventory policy, replenishes customers subject to a vehicle capacity constraint. Shipments incur transportation costs (computed from distances between the supplier and customers, and among customers), and both the supplier and customers incur inventory holding costs. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the supplier's inventory cost, the customers' inventory cost, and the transportation cost.",

The second line contains supplier information: supplier index, x coordinate, y coordinate, starting inventory level, production quantity per time period, and unit inventory cost. Each of the following lines contains, for a customer, the customer index, x coordinate, y coordinate, starting inventory level, maximum inventory level, minimum inventory level, demand rate per time period, and unit inventory cost."
